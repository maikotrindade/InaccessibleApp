# The Inaccessible App
Inaccessible App is a poorly designed Android app that ignores accessibility standards. It lacks clear labels, sufficient color contrast, and proper focus indicators. Key elements are too small to tap, and images have no alternative text. This makes it difficult for users with disabilities to use the app effectively.
